A JavaScript project

1.This is a JavaScript project  with browser template and no external library and framework has been used in this project.

2.I have added a onclick event on the Go to recipe button which will give a window alert and which displays "Recipes coming  soon".

3.In the News letter section i am adding the contact to the Local Storage of the Browser via onclick event when the user clicks on the Add friend button.
This is the  temporary effort due to absence of API but in real project we can perform an  API post request to save the data to the database.

4. Similarly, when the user clicks on the remove button, an onclick event  will be  triggered and that will update the array of added  contacts in local storage. 

5.I have tried to make it a responsive design but this Web application is best suitable for the screen 1366 X 768 resolution.
